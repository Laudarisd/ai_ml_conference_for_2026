## ⚡ Notes
- **TBA** = “To Be Announced” (exact deadlines not yet released).  
- Most top-tier AI conferences open submissions **6–9 months before event dates**.  
- Always check the official **Call for Papers (CFP)** for final deadlines and formatting guidelines.  

---

## 🎯 Recommendations
- If your focus is **medical imaging** → target **MICCAI 2026**.  
- If it’s **general computer vision** → **ICIP 2026**, **ICLR 2026**, or **AAAI 2026**.  
- If it’s **document/image-text** → **ICDAR 2026**.  
- For **signal + multimodal** → **ICASSP 2026**.  
- For **graphics & imaging** → **SIGGRAPH 2026**.
